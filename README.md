# VTOL interface 🚁+✈

## Place and period of internship:

NTI Center for Component «Technologies robotics and mechatronics», unmanned technology laboratory.
The Unmanned Technology Laboratory develops specialized robotic systems designed for specific tasks
in a variety of applications. The field of special robotics includes both the sphere of interaction
with a person and the replacement of a person in hazardous and harmful operations, such as work on
nuclear reactors or in the immediate vicinity of hazardous substances and emissions, work on oil
production plants, maintenance of infrastructure in difficult natural conditions, work under extreme
weather conditions and strong magnetic fields.

## Technical task
